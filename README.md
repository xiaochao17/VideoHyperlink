# VideoHyperlink
Built an authoring tool with interfaces to setup hyper linked videos with Python and OpenCV, which can import RGB raw videos, select areas to track, and save the link information between videos;

Created an interactive video player using Java, which can play synchronized videos and audios and jump to another video by clicking certain areas created from the authoring tool;
